General Engineering Principles + .NET API
Unified Identity: Use Po{SolutionName} as the master prefix for all namespaces, Azure Resource Groups, and Aspire resources (e.g., PoTask1.API, rg-PoTask1-prod).
Global Cleanup: Maintain a "zero-waste" codebase by deleting unused files, dead code, and obsolete assets.
Safety Standards: Use Directory.Build.props at the root to enforce <TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors> and <Nullable>enable</Nullable>.
Health Checks: Implement a /health endpoint to verify connections to all APIs and databases.
Context Management: Use .copilotignore to exclude bin/, obj/, and node_modules/ from AI focus.
Telemetry: Enable OpenTelemetry globally; aggregate to Application Insights in PoShared.
Tooling & Packages: Use Context7 MCP for latest SDKs and Central Package Management (CPM) via Directory.Packages.props with transitive pinning.
API UI: Use OpenApi 
Secrets & Config:
Local: Use dotnet user-secrets; backup in PoShared Key Vault.
Cloud: Use Azure Key Vault via Managed Identity within subscription Punkouter26 (Bbb8dfbe-9169-432f-9b7a-fbf861b51037).
Shared Resources: Locate common services and secrets in the PoShared resource group.
Development:
Create .http files for API debugging.
Implement robust server/browser logging for function calls.
Apply GoF/SOLID patterns + explanatory comments when possible
Ports: Use 5000 (HTTP) and 5001 (HTTPS).
For any major feature created , create corresponding UNIT/INTEGRATION/E2E tests
All apps should have /diag page that exposes all connection string, keys, values, secrets in json format / hide middle of values for security
In Plan Mode, if there is any ambiguity or need for further input, you must use the #tool:vscode/askQuestions tool to stop and consult me before proceeding with implementation.
Testing Strategy
Unit (C#): Pure logic and domain rules.
Integration (C#): API/DB testing using Testcontainers (SQL/Redis).
E2E (Playwright/TS): Headless Chromium/Mobile for critical paths. Run headed in dev. Auth Bypass: Use a test-only login endpoint or custom AuthenticationHandler.
Conditional Schemes: Register AddGoogle() for Prod; add AddTestAuth() in Dev to allow faking OAuth via /dev-login / Use dev login for e2e testing and testing manually running locally














App Stacks
Blazor Web App (Azure App Service)
Framework: .NET 10 Unified (SSR + WASM).
Architecture: Vertical Slice (VSA)—group DTOs, logic, and endpoints by feature.
